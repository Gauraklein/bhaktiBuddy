# Bhakti Buddy

This is a react native app created with the idea of helping bhakti yogis stay focused on their path. It will be IOS focused, but may be open to android support

## Key Features

- **Japa Tracker:** This feature will allow users to set a Japa goal for each day then allow them to track whether they were able to hit that goal. It will allow for users to keep track of how many rounds overdue they are etc. Ideas attached to this: *Calendar view, Counter*

- **Reflections** This feature will prompt users with a question each day. Something like "What inspired you today?" The timing of those prompts is TBD but the basic idea is that users should be able to reflect daily. Ideas attached to this: *Daily log/journal to view previous reflections, on this day one year ago*

- **Daily Inspiration** This feature is a quote or piece of media that is given to a user everyday, I like the idea of random ones for each user pulled from a db but it may be easier to just have a set one each day. Ideas attached to this: *Quote Scraper*

## Tech

*Still deciding but a basic outline would be:*

- React Native

- React Navigation

- Redux
